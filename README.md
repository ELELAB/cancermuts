## cancermuts

### Description

Cancermuts is a package for the automtic retrieval and annotation of cancer
mutations. At the moment it supports:

* Retrieval of protein sequence from UniProt
* Annotation of the sequence with data from
    * cBioPortal - cancer mutations
    * COSMIC - cancer mutations (after SNP filtering)
    * ELM - linear motifs
    * REVEL - pathogenicity prediction
    * Phosphosite - post-translational modifications
    * Manually curated annotations from csv files

The gathered data also includes some meta-data and more details.

The results of this process can be written in a meta-table csv file.

* Annotation of the sequence with data from
    * cBioPortal - cancer mutations
    * COSMIC - cancer mutations (after SNP filtering)
    * ELM - linear motifs
    * REVEL - pathogenicity prediction
    * Phosphosite - post-translational modifications
    * Manually curated annotations from csv files

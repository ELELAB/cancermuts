During the gget alphafold setup, the function contained in alphafold/alphafold/data/tools/jackhmmer.py 
is altered as follows:
- The path to save the temporary Jackhmmer database chunks is replaced (old: /tmp/ramdisk ; 
new: ~/tmp/jackhmmer/{UUID} , where UUID is a unique identifier) using the following command:
f"sed -i '' 's/\/tmp\/ramdisk/~\/tmp\/jackhmmer\/{UUID}/g' ./alphafold/alphafold/data/tools/jackhmmer.py"
- The logging level is altered by adding: "logging.set_verbosity(logging.WARNING)"
